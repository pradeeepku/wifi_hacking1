Enabling monitor mode on a wireless interface.
Scanning nearby Wi-Fi networks for information such as BSSID, ESSID, channels, and encryption types.
Performing deauthentication attacks on target networks to disconnect clients.
Features
User-friendly, menu-driven interface.
Automates enabling monitor mode for wireless network interfaces.
Scans and lists nearby Wi-Fi networks using airodump-ng.
Allows targeted deauthentication attacks using aireplay-ng.
Automatically stops monitor mode upon exiting.
